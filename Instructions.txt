The program reads information from the "Input Data" folder. Therefore, please enter the images you wish to use the program on in this folder.
The program reads information from the folder in alphabetical order. Therefore, it is recomended you use a filename/numbering system such as "plate 001", "plate 002".
The provided data already has a pre-existing filename/numbering system; however, you are still advised to pay attention to what you leave in the Input Data folder.

The program treats front and back plates differently. As such, you are required to edit the "Plate Type.csv" file when you enter new images.
The Plate Type CSV consists of 1 line, containing the words "True" or "False", always seperated by a comma. Please enter "True" if an image is a front plate, or "False" if an image is a back plate, in the alphabetical order of images in the Input Data folder.

The program will take longer to run the more images you ask it to process. It is therefore reccomended you run the program on no more than 10 images at a time if you wish to see quick results.
The program sometimes has trouble discerning what is a bugsplat and what is a plate feature. For optimal results, enter images of your plate clean and dirty, and deduct the former output from the latter.
The program sometimes has trouble with number plates containing "tags" such as flags on the side of a plate. While some tags such as green "zero emission" tags should be fine, for optimal results you may want to crop other tags from input images.
